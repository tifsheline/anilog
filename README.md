#**AniLog!**

###A Social App for Your Pet

###Overview
This webapp is designed with the purpose of creating an online community for animals (and people) to connect and share their journey.

There are channels of YouTube dedicated to animals.  There are IG accounts designed specifically for animals.  But there is no place for an animals voice to be heard (not in the literal sense, of course).  Now there's a webapp where pet owners can be their pet's voice.  Why not share your animal and everything that's special about it with the world?
