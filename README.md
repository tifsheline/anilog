#**Anilog!**

##A Ruby on Rails Based Social App for Your Pet

This webapp is designed with the purpose of creating an online community for pets (and thier owners) to connect and share their journey.

There are channels on YouTube dedicated to animals.  There are IG accounts created specifically for pets.  But there is no place for an animals voice to be heard (not in the literal sense, of course).  Now there's a webapp where pet owners can be their pet's voice.

##How do I Join?

Check out the following link to join Anilog (https://shielded-stream-97248.herokuapp.com/).  This site provides a secure way to create a profile and login information with an email and password.  Upload a profile pic and you're ready to start socializing with other pet owners.  You can update your pet's status,  visit other Anilogs and comment on their status.

## Development Process

Technologies Used: RoR / Bootstrap / HTML / CSS

By creating models, controllers, and actions in RoR, users of this site are able to create new profiles, log in and out, view other profiles, and add comments to other users' status.  BCrypt gives users a secure way to create and access their profiles.  Bootstrap and paperclips gems were used for styling and to give users the capability of uploading photos.
