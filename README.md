#**AniLog!**

##A Ruby on Rails Based Social App for Your Pet

This webapp is designed with the purpose of creating an online community for animals (and people) to connect and share their journey.

There are channels of YouTube dedicated to animals.  There are IG accounts designed specifically for animals.  But there is no place for an animals voice to be heard (not in the literal sense, of course).  Now there's a webapp where pet owners can be their pet's voice.  Why not share your animal and everything that's special about it with the world?

##How do I Join?

Check out the following link to join AniLog.  This site provides a secure way to create a profile and login information with an email and password.  Upload a profile pic and ready to start socializing with other pets.  You can update your pet's status,  visit other AniLogs and comment on their status.

## Development Process

Technologies Used: RoR / Bootstrap / HTML / CSS

By creating models, controllers, and actions in RoR, the site is able to create new profiles, allow users to log in and out, view other profiles, and add comments to other users' status.  Bootstrap and paperclips gems were used for styling and to give users the capability of uploading photos.  

## Not-Yet-Implemented

* Uploading videos
* Detailed graphic design
